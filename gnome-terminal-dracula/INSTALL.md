### [Gnome Terminal](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Terminal)

#### Install

This theme can be installed on Gnome 3 terminal and any other Gnome based terminal program like the Unity terminal bundled with Ubuntu.

You'll need the `dconf` command (if you run a recent Gnome version). In Ubuntu,this can be installed by running:

    sudo apt-get install dconf-cli

In other distros you'll need to dig around to find it, search your repositories for __dconf__ related packages.

After installing dconf, you can clone this repository to your machine.

    git clone https://github.com/dracula/gnome-terminal
    cd gnome-terminal

Then you can run the installation script:

    ./install.sh

And just follow the steps.

#### Addons

To complement your user experience I recommend installing [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md). This is going to allow commands to have their own colors and styles.
